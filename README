To generate simulated datasets do this:

migtree < parmfile.stepstone | migdata 

it will print some auxillary stuff to the screen but will 
produce a file called infile with the sequences in it.

migdata is not interactive and gets all its stuff through the migtree
output what that is you can check by doing
migtree < parmfile.stepstone > gugus
and then look at gugus

Here an example parmfile for the simlator
I explain each line after #
I am not  sure if such a file would work if there are # in it so
