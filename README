To generate simulated datasets do this:
[check out the example directory]
migtree < parmfile.sequence | migdata 

it will print some auxillary stuff to the screen but will 
produce a file called infile with the sequences in it.

migdata is not interactive and gets all its stuff through the migtree
output what that is you can check by doing
migtree < parmfile.stepstone > trees
and then look at trees

Here an example parmfile for the simulator
I explain each line after #
the parmfile for the simulator cannot contain any comment!
